<p>Motivation: Genome replication is one of the most important tasks carried out in the cell. Before a cell can divide, it must first replicated its genome so that each of the two daughter cells inherits its own copy.</p>

<strong>Block 1 - DNA Replication</strong>
<p>
DNA Replication is the biological process of producing two identical replicas of DNA from one original DNA molecule. 
DNA Replication occurs in all living organisms acting as the basis for biological inheritance.
</p>
<p>
DNA is made up of a double helix of two complementary strands. 
During replication, these strands are separated. 
Each strand of the original DNA molecule then serves as a template for the production of its counterpart, 
a process referred to as semiconservativva replication. As a result of semi-conservative replication, 
the new helix will be composed of an original DNA strand as well as a newly synthesized strand.

<strong>Block 2 - Replication Origin</strong>
<p>
Replication begins in a genomic region called the replication origin (denoted ori) 
and is carried out by molecular copy machines called DNA polymerases.
</p>
<p>
Replication is performed by DNA polymerase and the initiation of replication is mediated by a protein called DnaA.
DnaA binds to short (typically 9 nucleotides long) segments within the replication origin known as a DnaA box.
A DnaA box is a hidden message telling DnaA to "bind here!" And DnaA wants to see multiple DnaA boxes.
