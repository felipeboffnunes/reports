<strong>Block 1 - Epistemology (Meaning)</strong>
<p>
Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that addresses philosophical questions about knowledge and rationality. Epistemologists are primarily interested in questions about the nature of knowledge and the principles governing rational belief.
A good way to begin is to look at the things we ordinarily say and think about knowledge and rationality. By systematizing and reflecting on them, we will arrive at a set of questions and puzzles.
</p>

<strong>Block 2 - The Standard View</strong>
<p>
The Standard View are the commonly (but not universally) accepted ideas about what we know and how we know things.
In the ordinary course of events, people claim to know many things and they attribute knowledge to others in a variety of cases. Most of us think we know quite a lot. Statements about mathematics, scientific facts, our own thoughts and feelings, our immediate environment, religion and morality are some of the examples of the sort of things we can know.
</p>
<strong>Block 3 - The Standard View (Thesis)</strong>
<p>
<strong>"We know a large variety of things in several categories."</strong>
</p>
<p>
For this thesis to be right, then there are some ways we come to know the things it says we know; there are some sources for our knowledge.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Perception (our senses)
</li><li>
Memory
</li><li>
Testimony (of someone we trust)
</li><li>
Introspection
</li><li>
Reasoning
</li><li>
Rational Insight (elementary arithmetic, simple logic)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Standard View holds that we can gain knowledge from these sources, it does not say that these sources are perfect. Sometimes our memories are mistaken, sometimes our senses mislead us.
</p>

<strong>Block 4 - Questioning</strong>
<p>
Numerous questions arise once we reflect on The Standard View. These questions constitute the primary subject matter of epistemology.
</p>
<p>
"Under what conditions does a person know something to be true?"
</p>
<p>
One might think it is a matter of how sure a person feels about something or whether there is general agreement about the matter. Those are not good answers. 
According to many philosophers, an important condition on knowledge is rational or justified belief. To know something requires having a good reason to believe it, you do not know something if you are just guessing.
</p>
<p>
"Under what conditions is a belief justified (or reasonable or rational)?
</p>
<p>
This questions stays, at least for now.
</p>

<strong>Block 5 - Challenging the Standard View</strong>
<p>
It is evident there are reasons to wonder whether this commonsense view really is correct. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Skeptical View
<ul>
<li>
Skeptics think that The Standard View is far too charitable and self-indulgent. 
</li><li>
Some skeptical arguments rely on seemingly bizarre possibilities
<ul>
<li>
You are dreaming all along.
</li><li>
You are inside a simulation.
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Other skeptical arguments do not rely on odd hypotheses like these, but all of them challenge our comfortable commonsense view.
</li><li>
"Do we really have any knowledge at all? Is there any good response to the argument of the skeptics?"
</li>
</ul>
<li>
The Naturalistic View
<ul>
<li>
Emphasizes the role of natural (or empirical or experimental) science.
</li><li>
There is a body of research about the ways people think and reason that is troubling. It shows systematic and widespread errors and confusions in how we think and reason.
</li><li>
"In what ways, if at all, do results in natural science, especially cognitive psychology, bear on epistemological questions? Do recent empirical results undermine The Standard View?"
</li>
</ul>
<li>
The Relativistic View
<ul>
<li>
People's beliefs and their policies for forming beliefs differ widely.
<ul>
<li>
Some people are willing to believe on the basis of rather little evidence.
</li><li>
Some people are strong believers in the power of science.
<ul>
<li>
"The methods of science provide the only reasonable way to learn about the world around us."
</li>
<li>
They sometimes regard others as irrational for believing in such things as astrology and reincarnation.
</ul>
<li>
Seemingly intelligent people can find themselves seriously at odds with one another over a lot of issues.
</ul>
<li>
The fact that there is much disagreements leads some people to wonder whether in each case one party to the dispute must be unreasonable. A comforting thought to many is that there is room for reasonable disagreement, at least on certain topics.
<ul><li>
Two people can have different points of view, yet each can be reasonable in maintaining his or her view.
</li>
</ul>
<li>
"What are the epistemological implications of cognitive diversity? Are there universal standards of rationality, applicable to all people at all times? Under what circumstances can rational people disagree with one another?"
</li>
</ul>
