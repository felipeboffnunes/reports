<strong> Block 1 - Critical Thinking</strong>
<p>
Our primary tool in making better judgments is critical thinking. Critical thinking is the careful application of reason in the determination of whether a claim is true.
</p>
<p>
The things we’ll see here are applicable to nearly any subject people can talk or think about.
</p>
<p>
The same principles that apply to your everyday decisions also apply to issues of worldwide importance. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
determine what information is or is not pertinent;
</li><li>
distinguish between rational claims and emotional ones;
</li><li>
separate fact from opinion;
</li><li>
recognize the ways in which evidence might be limited or compromised;
</li><li>
spot deception and holes in the arguments of others;
</li><li>
present his /her own analysis of the data or information;
</li><li>
recognize logical flaws in arguments;
</li><li>
draw connections between discrete sources of data and information;
</li><li>
attend to contradictory, inadequate, or ambiguous information;
</li><li>
construct cogent arguments rooted in data rather than opinion;
</li><li>
select the strongest set of supporting data;
</li><li>
avoid overstated conclusions;
</li><li>
identify holes in the evidence and suggest additional information to collect;
</li><li>
propose other options and weigh them in the decision;
</li><li>
consider all stakeholders or affected parties in suggesting a course of action;
</li><li>
articulate the argument and the context for that argument;
</li><li>
correctly and precisely use evidence to defend the argument;
</li><li>
logically and cohesively organize the argument;
</li>
</ul>

<strong> Block 2 - Claim</strong>
<p>
Claims are the things we say, aloud or in writing, to convey information—to express our opinions or beliefs.
</p>
<p>
The claims we investigate can be about anything, whether of modest interest or of earth-shaking importance. Claims about whether your toothpaste whitens your teeth, whether an ace-high flush beats a full house, whether a president should be impeached or a war begun—everything is fair game. This is true whether you or someone else has actually made the claim or is only considering it. Many claims require little or no critical evaluation. They are so obviously true (or false, as the case may be) that nobody would see any need for a close examination. 
</p>
<p>
But many claims can and should be given a close look and evaluation—claims about important personal decisions (Should you marry the person you’re seeing?), about societal matters (Should we have universal health care in this country?), about the nature of the world (Do supernatural events sometimes happen?). Some people hold offices in which their decisions deeply affect others; perhaps the claims they make about such decisions should be given an especially high level of scrutiny.
<p>
<strong> Block 3 - Issues</strong>
<p>
Whenever we call a claim into question—that is, when we ask questions about its truth or falsity—we raise an issue. Claims, construed as issues and supported (or not) by arguments, are the central focus of critical thinking.
</p>
<p>
An issue is nothing more than a question—in fact, we can use the two
words interchangeably—the question is simply whether a given claim is true or not. 
</p>
<p>
As we’ll see, in many real-life situations it is important and often difficult to, identify exactly what claim is in question—exactly what the issue is. This happens for lots of different reasons, from purposeful obfuscation to ambiguous terminology to plain muddleheaded thinking.
</p>
<p>
Mathematical theorems are confirmed not via experimentation but rather as deductions from other mathematical propositions. Appearing in the Bible would count as proof of a statement if you believe that the Bible is the revealed word of God, though doubters might press you on that. The point is that you need to have some idea about what counts for or against a claim’s truth if you are to entertain it seriously, or if you expect others to take it seriously.
</p>
<strong> Block 4 - Arguments</strong>
<p>
Arguments are the single most important ingredient in critical thinking. We produce an argument when we give a reason for thinking that a claim is true.
</p>
<p>
A claim that is offered as a reason for believing another claim is a premise. The claim for which a premise is supposed to give a reason is the conclusion of the argument.
</p>
<p>
Whether his argument is a good one depends on whether the premise really does support the conclusion—whether it really gives us a reason for thinking the conclusion is true. We’ll be going into the matter in some depth later, but for now we should point out that there are two components to the premise’s support of the conclusion. First, the premise can offer support for the conclusion only if the premise is true. So this may require independent investigation—indeed, more arguments may be required to support this claim. In that case, it will be the conclusion of some other argument, and it will be the premise of the argument we’re considering. Claims operate like this all the time; a premise in one argument will turn up as the conclusion of another. 
</p>
<p>
The second requirement for a premise’s support of a conclusion is that it be relevant to the conclusion. Sometimes this is expressed by saying the premise is cogent. This requirement means that the premise, if true, must actually bear on the truth of the conclusion—that is, it must actually increase the likelihood that the conclusion is true.
</p>
<p>
An argument consists of two parts; one part (the premise or premises) supposedly provides a reason for thinking that the other part (the conclusion) is true.
</p>
<p>
Explanations and arguments are different things. Basically, an argument attempts to support or prove a conclusion, while an explanation specifies what caused something or how it works or what it is made out of and so forth.
</p>
<strong> Block 5 - Two kinds of good arguments</strong>
<p>
Deductive Arguments:
</p>
<li>A good deductive argument, is said to be “valid,” which means it isn’t possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. To put all this differently, the premises of a good deductive argument, assuming they are true, prove or demonstrate the conclusion.
</li>
<p></p>
<p>
Inductive Arguments:
</p>
<li>
A good inductive argument, don’t prove or demonstrate the conclusion. They support it. This means that, assuming they are true, they raise the probability that the conclusion is true. The more support the premises of an argument provide for a conclusion, the stronger the argument is said to be. 
</li>
